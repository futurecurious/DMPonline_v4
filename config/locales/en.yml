    body_text_tab_1_html: "<div class='white_background'>
    <p>
    There is a growing call for researchers to prepare data management plans. The University of Alberta has adopted a <a href='https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Research-Records-Stewardship-Guidance-Procedure.pdf' target='_blank'>research records stewardship policy</a>, which describes how research data and associated records should be managed and preserved. It is also becoming more common for funding agencies to ask for data management plans (DMP) as part of grant requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
    The University of Alberta Libraries has provided this tool for data management plans (DMP Builder) to help researchers with  data management planning process. This tool is powered by DMPOnline, which is produced by the <a href='http://www.dcc.ac.uk/' target='_blank'>Digital Curation Centre</a> in the UK.  All data is locally hosted here at the University of Alberta.  See our <a href='/terms?locale=en'>terms of use</a> for more information. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <h3>How the tool works</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>Currently, this tool includes a generic University of Alberta DMP template for researchers to use.  Guidance is provided to help you interpret and answer the questions.</p>
    <p>We want your feedback! If you have suggestions on how to improve the existing template, or you would like to add additional templates based on funding agency requirements or disciplinary needs, please contact us at <a href='mailto:data@ualberta.ca?Subject=DMP%20Builder%20feedback'>data@ualberta.ca</a>.
    </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>

    <p>Please note that we are currently working on CCID authentication. You will have the option to link your existing account to your CCID when that feature becomes available.</p>

    body_text_tab_1_html: "<p>When you login to DMP Builder you will be directed to the 'My plans' page. From here you can edit, share, export or delete any of your plans. You will also see plans that have been shared with you by others.</p>
    <h3>Create a plan</h3>
    <p>To create a plan, click the 'Create plan' button from the 'My plans' page or  the top menu. Select options from the drop-down menus and tickboxes to determine what questions and guidance you should be presented with. Confirm your selection by clicking 'Yes, create plan'</p>
    <h3>Write your plan</h3>
    <p>The tabbed interface allows you to navigate through different functions when editing your plan.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>- 'Plan details' includes basic administrative details, tells you what sets of questions and guidance your plan is based on and gives you an overview to the questions that you will be asked.</li>
      <li>- The following tab(s) present the questions to answer. There may be more than one tab if your funder or university asks different sets of questions at different stages e.g. at grant application and post-award.</li>
      <li>- The 'Share' tab allows you to invite others to read or contribute to your plan.</li>
      <li>- The 'Export' tab allows you to download your plan in various formats. This may be useful if you need to submit your plan as part of a grant application.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When viewing any of the question tabs, you will see the different sections of your plan displayed. Click into these in turn to answer the questions. You can format your responses using the text editing buttons.</p>
    <p>Guidance is displayed in the right-hand panel. Click the '+' symbol to view this.</p>
    <p>Remember to 'save' your responses before moving on.</p>
    <h3>Share plans</h3>
    <p>Insert the email address of any collaborators you would like to invite to read or edit your plan. Set the level of permissions you would like to grant them via the drop-down options and click to 'Add collaborator'</p>
    <h3>Export plans</h3>
    <p>From here you can download your plan in various formats. This may be useful if you need to submit your plan as part of a grant application. Choose what format you would like to view/download your plan in and click to export. When you login to DMP Builder you will be directed to the 'My plans' page.
