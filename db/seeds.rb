    guidance: "<p>The type of data you collect will impact your storage requirements.  Textual and tabular data files are usually very small (a few megabytes) unless you have a lot of data.  Video files are usually very large (hundreds of megabytes up to several gigabytes).  If you have a large amount of data (gigabytes or terabytes), it will be more challenging to share and transfer it.  You may need to consider networked storage options or more sophisticated backup methods.</p>\r\n<p>If your data will be changing frequently, please estimate how much extra storage will be required to store multiple versions.  If you are collecting data over a long period of time (e.g. several months or years), please describe your plan for adding additional storage to accommodate the growth of your data.</p>"
